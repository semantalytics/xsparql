# Application location to alternative location mappings.
#
# + Order does not matter.
# + The location mapping parser looks for lm:mapping properties
#   and uses the object value so this can be written in several different styles.
#
# The translation algorithm is:
#
# 1 - Exact mappings: these are tried before attempting a prefix match.
# 2 - By prefix: find the longest matching prefix
# 3 - Use the original if no alternative.

# Use N3's , (multiple objects => multiple statements of same subject and predicate)
