OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XSPARQL is a simple merge of SPARQL components into XQuery. In order
to benefit from the more intuitive facilities of SPARQL in terms of
RDF graph matching for retrieval of RDF data and the use of
Turtle-like syntax for result construction, we syntactically add these
facilities to XQuery.

DOWNLOADING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can download XSPARQL in two different ways: 

1) Package: the packaged XSPARQL is available for download on the
   Sourceforge project page:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsparql

  You should download the package that uses the same Python version on
  which you are going to install.

2) SVN: you can get the current svn version of XSPARQL by running the
  following command:

        svn co https://xsparql.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xsparql xsparql  

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing XSPARQL requires the following software:

Python
------

You need Python >= 2.4 and python-setuptools.  You can get Python from
the web page: http://www.python.org/ or there are packaged versions of
Python distributed with your UNIX based operating system.

Python Lex-Yacc
---------------

You can get Python Lex-Yacc from: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/.  If you
are installing from the packaged file you can safely skip this step
since it will install Python Lex-Yacc when you install the package.


Invoke the following command to install XSPARQL:

  $ python setup.py install

See also http://docs.python.org/inst/.

If you downloaded the packaged version of XSPARQL you can install it
by running:

  $ easy_install package_file

For further details you can see: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run XSPARQL you need:

XQuery engine
-------------

You can get XQilla (http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/) or Saxon (http://saxon.sourceforge.net/).
XSPARQL is mostly tested using XQilla and is thus recommended you install XQilla. 


SPARQL Endpoint
---------------
You can get Joseki from http://www.joseki.org/.


xsparqler.py is a rewriter for XSPARQL to XQuery. You can
transform an XSPARQL file to an XQuery file using the following
command:

  $ xsparqler.py example.xsparql > out.xquery

Run 'out.xquery' using the installed XQuery engine.
