* DONE check w/ Wassen the diffs between online interface and CVS
* DONE check examples on the ml into examples
* DONE Create syntax textcases
  This is quite useful in order to change the grammar without problems
* DONE Fix the rewriter
  The current XSPARQL CVS version is not working in some cases,
  including some of the web interface examples.
* DONE allow FILTER in GroupGraphPatterns
* DONE "let $x := ... , $y := ... , $z := ..." is not working
  todo02.xsparql
* DONE invent a new comment sequence (I like "-- "); (: :) and # is not working
  using #
* DONE fix shift-reduce conflicts in the parser
* DONE "... return <criterion2><name>{$name}</name><weight>{$weight}</weight></criterion2> ..." does not work
  todo01.xsparql : first syntax works
  but we can use "... return <criterion2>{(<name>{$name}</name>,<weight>{$weight}</weight>)}</criterion2> ..."


* TODO build abstract syntax tree instead of in-place rewriting
* TODO EMPTY keyword in XQuery is currently non-functional, clashes with fn:empty
* TODO all variables are global 
  parsing of bound variables does not work properly (this goes in line with AST representation)
* TODO parsing "... RETURN <foo>bar bar</foo> ..." does not work
  todo03.xsparql
* TODO modules are not working
  declare function is working

* TODO rewriter always _needs_ a namespace declaration, fix that.
* TODO rewrite nested CONSTRUCTs properly
