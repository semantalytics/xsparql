	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py (p_qname): Resolved 1
	shift/reduce by using the definition from:
	http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName and defining one new
	terminal.  Removed the rule sparqlqname.
	(p_blank): removed bnodeWithExpr (to check foaf_lifting)
	(find_column): new function to calculate the column in case of
	syntax error.  New error reporting format.

	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py: grammar refactoring.
	There are still 2 shift/reduce and the grammar was restricted in
	the following ways:
	1) example query/fdwlm.xsparql: return <user></user><dist></dist>
	is not allowed.  It needs to be return <node><user></user><dist></dist></node>
	2) FOR (...) constructTemplate letClause solutionmodifier was
	removed. To check how to add later.

	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py: added comments in the
	form '(: ' and ' :)'
	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py: changed the NCNAME
	definition: according to
	http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName it cannot start with
	a digit


2008-07-18  Nuno Lopes  <nuno.lopes@deri.org>

	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql: bring code in CVS to the same state
	as the web interface.  Some revisions were discarded.  The parser
	now returns exit code 1 on syntax error.
	* online-interface: rewrite xsparqlrewrite to handle more
	cases. If there is a parse error return the original query.
