	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py: added comments in the
	form '(: ' and ' :)'
	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql/grammar.py: changed the NCNAME
	definition: according to
	http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName it cannot start with
	a digit

	* software/xsparqlow/xsparql: bring code in CVS to the same state
	as the web interface.  Some revisions were discarded.  The parser
	now returns exit code 1 on syntax error.
	* online-interface: rewrite xsparqlrewrite to handle more
	cases. If there is a parse error return the original query.
