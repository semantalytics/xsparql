README XSPARQL


## Prerequisites

You will need at least:

  * [Java JDK (at least Java 5)](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/)
  * [Apache Maven 2](http://maven.apache.org/)

The central Apache Maven repository contains almost all dependencies of XSPARQL. Because of licensing issues the following dependencies have to be downloaded manually and installed to your local maven repository:

  * The Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited, download from http://www.saxonica.com/
    if you have a license for Saxon EE you can use saxon9-ee.jar
    otherwise the home edition (HE) is enough (saxon9.jar)

    Install the jar file in your local maven repository:
    
    `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.sf.saxon -DartifactId=saxon -Dversion=9.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-jar-file>`


## Building XSPARQL

In the main xsparql directory (where you probably found this README) run maven with the install goal:

   `mvn install`

When running the first time this will take some time since maven will download all the dependencies from the central repository.


## OPTIONAL

If you want to use Graphviz to visualize a syntax tree download it from

   http://www.graphviz.org/

or from a repository if available for your platform.
Don't forget to set the path accordingly if not already done by the installation procedure.

You will also need a directory called ./tfd for the dot files and the generated files.


## Running XSPARQL

You can run xsparql from the the created jar file:

   `java -jar lang/target/lang-0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar query.xs`

To get an overview of the possible parameters of xsparql execute

   `java -jar lang/target/lang-0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h`

You can also assign values to variables declared as external using an equals sign ($graph in this example):

   `java -jar lang/target/lang-0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar query.xs graph="file:///home/user/graph.rdf"`
